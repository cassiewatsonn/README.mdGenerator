# README.mdGenerator

## Description

This README Generator is for users looking to quickly and easily create a quality README.md file by using a command-line application. The main goal of this project is to allow project creators to spend more time working on their projects and less time on the README's.  

As an aspriring web developer I want to be able to spend less time working on README's so I can spend more time on projects so I can build on my knowledge to further my studies.

## Installation 

This command-line application generates a professional README.md from a users input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4). To install this package, you will gather the files from the README.mdGenerator GitHub Respoitory by Cassandra Watson (https://github.com/cassiewatsonn/README.mdGenerator). Once you have all of the files, navigate to your terminal and input 'npm install'. This will install the inquirer package from the package.json file. 

## Usage

Once successfully installed, open the terminal from the index.js file. When in the terminal input 'node index.js'. This will prompt your first question. Begin filling out all of the questions that you are prompted for (ensure to hit enter after you complete each question). Once you have completed all of the questions you will receive a message saying "Creating your README.md file!". Look at your files and you should see that a new README.md file has arrived. Click on the file and your README is ready!
