## Installation 

This command-line application generates a professional README.md from a users input using theÂ Inquirer package. To install this package, you will gather the files from the README.mdGenerator GitHub Respoitory by Cassandra Watson (https://github.com/cassiewatsonn/README.mdGenerator). Once you have all of the files, navigate to your terminal and input 'npm install'. This will install the inquirer package from the package.json file.

## Usage 

Once successfully installed, open the terminal from the index.js file. When in the terminal input 'node index.js'. This will prompt your first question. Begin filling out all of the questions that you are prompted for (ensure to hit enter after you complete each question). Once you have completed all of the questions you will receive a message saying "Creating your README.md file!". Look at your files and you should see that a new README.md file has arrived. Click on the file and your README is ready!
